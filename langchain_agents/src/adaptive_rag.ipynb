Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.', 'language': 'en'}, page_content='Long-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9.

Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n...

Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n...

Types of Memory in AI Agents Types of Memory in AI Agents ---------------------------- Memory management in AI agents incorporates short-term memory for context and long-term memory using external storage, such as vector databases, enabling efficient information retrieval and enhanced reasoning. Memory management in AI agents is crucial for optimizing performance and enhancing user interactions. By leveraging short-term, long-term, and contextual memory, agents can provide more personalized and efficient interactions, ultimately leading to better outcomes for users. This ongoing development aims to enhance memory management in AI agents, ensuring they can provide more coherent and contextually relevant interactions. Types of Memory in AI Agents\\nIt includes short-term memory via context windows and long-term memory through methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling more coherent and informed AI responses. Long-term memory in AI agents aims to address the limitations of short-term memory by providing a mechanism for storing and retrieving information over extended periods. Expanded Knowledge: RAG allows the AI to access a much larger pool of information than what could be included in a context window or model parameters. The interplay between short-term memory (context window) and long-term memory (RAG) is crucial for creating AI agents with more human-like memory capabilities. In conclusion, AI Agent Memory, encompassing both short-term memory via context windows and long-term memory through techniques like RAG, is a critical component in the development of more capable and human-like AI systems.\\nDeep dive into various types of Agent Memory STM: Working memory (LLM Context): It is a data structure with multiple parts which are usually represented with a prompt template and relevant variables.Before runtime, the STM is synthesized by replacing the relevant variables in the prompt template with information retrieved from the LTM.\\nMemory for agents Memory for agents At Sequoia’s AI Ascent conference in March, I talked about three limitations for agents: planning, UX, and memory. But what even is memory? While the exact shape of memory that your agent has may differ by application, we do see different high level types of memory. Below is my rough, ELI5 explanation of each type and practical ways for how todays agents may use and update this memory type. Besides just thinking about the type of memory to update in their agents, we also see developers thinking about how to update agent memory. One way to update agent memory is “in the hot path”.

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n...

Types of Memory in AI Agents Types of Memory in AI Agents ---------------------------- Memory management in AI agents incorporates short-term memory for context and long-term memory using external storage, such as vector databases, enabling efficient information retrieval and enhanced reasoning. Memory management in AI agents is crucial for optimizing performance and enhancing user interactions. By leveraging short-term, long-term, and contextual memory, agents can provide more personalized and efficient interactions, ultimately leading to better outcomes for users. This ongoing development aims to enhance memory management in AI agents, ensuring they can provide more coherent and contextually relevant interactions. Types of Memory in AI Agents\\nIt includes short-term memory via context windows and long-term memory through methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enabling more coherent and informed AI responses. Long-term memory in AI agents aims to address the limitations of short-term memory by providing a mechanism for storing and retrieving information over extended periods. Expanded Knowledge: RAG allows the AI to access a much larger pool of information than what could be included in a context window or model parameters. The interplay between short-term memory (context window) and long-term memory (RAG) is crucial for creating AI agents with more human-like memory capabilities. In conclusion, AI Agent Memory, encompassing both short-term memory via context windows and long-term memory through techniques like RAG, is a critical component in the development of more capable and human-like AI systems.\\nDeep dive into various types of Agent Memory STM: Working memory (LLM Context): It is a data structure with multiple parts which are usually represented with a prompt template and relevant variables.Before runtime, the STM is synthesized by replacing the relevant variables in the prompt template with information retrieved from the LTM.\\nMemory for agents Memory for agents At Sequoia’s AI Ascent conference in March, I talked about three limitations for agents: planning, UX, and memory. But what even is memory? While the exact shape of memory that your agent has may differ by application, we do see different high level types of memory. Below is my rough, ELI5 explanation of each type and practical ways for how todays agents may use and update this memory type. Besides just thinking about the type of memory to update in their agents, we also see developers thinking about how to update agent memory. One way to update agent memory is “in the hot path”. Why do we care about memory for agents?\\nSign up for Latest SuperAGI Updates\\n\"*\" indicates required fields\\nSuperAGI builds infrastructure components, tools, frameworks and models to enable opensource AGI\\ncommunity@superagi.com\\nFor Developers\\nDocs\\nGitHub\\nReleases\\nRoadmap\\nAPIs\\nCommunity\\nSupport Forum\\nMarketplace\\nSocial Mentions\\nReddit\\nCollectibles\\nResources\\nBlog\\nUse Cases\\nAGI Research Lab\\nTutorials\\nImportant Links\\nSuperAGI Cloud\\nApp Spotlight\\nSuperCoder\\nArchitecture\\n Check it out✨\\nFeatures\\nAction Console\\nResource Manager\\nTrajectory Fine-Tuning\\n\\u200c\\nMultiple Vector DBs\\nMulti-LLM Support\\nAgent Workflows\\nMarketplace\\nAgent Templates\\nDiscord\\nGitHub\\nTwitter\\nReddit\\nYoutube\\nTowards AGI (part 1): Agents with Memory\\nFebruary 6, 2024\\n7 mins read\\nAgents are an emerging class of artificial intelligence (AI) systems that use large language models (LLMs) to interact with the world. In a professional setup like this, the agent is responsible for extracting tasks from conversations and passing them to an employee and once the employee completes the task the agent will convey the output to the user. Then use the solutions of those basic tasks as in-context examples to solve the current task.\\nConclusion & Next Steps\\nIn this blog, we saw that design choices for Memory depend on the end use case. This analogy is better captured in the following table:\\nDeep dive into various types of Agent Memory\\nChoosing the right Memory design in Production\\nSince agents are powered by LLMs, they are inherently probabilistic.')]}\n"
